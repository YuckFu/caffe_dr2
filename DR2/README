1、System Requirements:
  This software has been tested on Linux 64-bit system.
  a.[Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) including matcaffe
  b.MATLAB

2、Reconstruction using ReconNet
  The pre-trained models for measurement rates of 0.25, 0.1, 0.04 and 0.01 and the corresponding measurement matrices are 
  provided in the ./DR2/test/caffemodels and ./DR2/test/phi directories respectively. ./DR2/test_images contains the test 
  images (downloaded from two sources: http://dsp.rice.edu/software/DAMP-toolbox and 
  http://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/wsdong/NLR_Exps.htm). The reconstructed images for the different measurement rates are 
  provided in ./DR2/test/reconstruction_results.

  To reproduce the results, first select a measurement rate by editing ./DR2/test/test_everything.m accordingly and 
  "run test_everything.m"

3、Training models:
  a.The network definition and parameters of the initial random weights of the network are provided in ./DR2/train/ folder.
  DR2_stage1.prototxt and DR2_stage1_solver.prototxt are the files for training fully-connected layer.
  DR2_stage2.prototxt and DR2_stage2_solver.prototxt are the files for training DR2-Net.

  b. Run generate_train.m from ./DR2/train/ directory in MATLAB to sample the image patches of size 33 by 33 which act as 
  the training labels, and the corresponding  random Gaussian measurements (using a measurement matrix in ./DR2/phi directory) 
  which act as training inputs for the network. The training inputs and labels will be saved in hdf5 format in ./DR2/train/train.h5. 
  Similarly run ./DR2/train/generate_test.m to generate the validation set which will be saved in test.h5.

  c.Running train_stage1.sh to accomplish the first stage. The trained model for stage1 is used to train stage2:train_stage2.sh.
